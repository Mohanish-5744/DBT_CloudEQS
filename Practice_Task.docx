--------------------DBT Basics Practice Questions--------------------

Scenario:
Under the model's folder in the DBT project, create a subfolder named staging. Use the INTERNAL_TRAINING.PRACTICE_MARCH2025 schema to bring the customers, orders, and products tables via a src.yml file. 
Create staging models on top of these source tables(name them as following): 
1. stg__customers (as a view) 
2.stg__orders (as a table) 
3. stg__products (as a table) 
Maintain separate YAML files for each model to document their respective columns and tests(unique and not null on primary key column)

DBT Incremental Model Practice Assignments

Assignment 1: Incremental Model with `append` Strategy

Objective:
- Create an incremental model for `orders` that appends new records.

Model Details:
- Model Name: `int__orders`
- Strategy: `append`
- Logic: Append only new orders based on `order_id`.

Challenge:
- Add a test to ensure `order_id` is unique and not null.

Assignment 2: Incremental Model with `delete+insert` Strategy

Objective:
- Create an incremental model for `products` that updates existing records and inserts new ones.

Model Details:
- Model Name: `int__products`
- Strategy: `delete+insert`
- Logic: Insert new products and update existing product details.

Challenge:
- Add tests for `product_id` uniqueness and `price` to be greater than zero.

Assignment 3: Incremental Model with `merge` Strategy

Objective:
- Build an incremental model for `customers` that efficiently updates records using the `merge` strategy.

Model Details:
- Model Name: `int__customers`
- Strategy: `merge`
- Logic: Update customer details and insert new customers.

Challenge:
- Add tests for `customer_id` uniqueness and `email` format validation.

Challenge

Create an audit model that tracks:
- The number of records processed in each incremental run.
- The timestamp of the last successful run.
